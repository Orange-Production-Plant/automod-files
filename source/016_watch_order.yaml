    It seems you may be asking about the proper order of experiencing the Danganronpa series. The proper order is Danganronpa 1 -> Danganronpa 2 -> Danganronpa Another Episode -> Danganronpa 3 (anime only) -> Danganronpa V3. 

    In terms of Danganronpa 3, you are intended to watch it in the following order: Future 1, Despair 1, Future 2, Despair 2, Future 3, and so on. Hope Arc replaces the final Despair Arc episode and serves as the finale. 

    Please note that you cannot go straight from Danganronpa: The Animation to Danganronpa 3, as Danganronpa 2 does not have an adaptation and is vital to understanding the plot of Danganronpa 3.
