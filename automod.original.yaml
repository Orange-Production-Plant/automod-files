    Your comment was removed because your spoiler tag was incorrectly formatted. While it may show fine on New Reddit, the tag will completely break on Old Reddit. Please place the spoiler marks next to the words you want to spoiler tag *without spaces*, like this:

    `>!spoiler text!<`

    Please repost your comment with the proper spoiler marks for it to display properly, as automod cannot approve edited comments.

    Your comment was removed because your spoiler tag was incorrectly formatted. Reddit uses different spoiler marks than Discord does, so using Discord's spoiler marks won't hide your spoilers on Reddit. Please format your spoiler marks like this:

    `>!spoiler text!<`

    It seems you may be asking about the proper order of experiencing the Danganronpa series. The proper order is Danganronpa 1 -> Danganronpa 2 -> Danganronpa Another Episode -> Danganronpa 3 (anime only) -> Danganronpa V3. 

    In terms of Danganronpa 3, you are intended to watch it in the following order: Future 1, Despair 1, Future 2, Despair 2, Future 3, and so on. Hope Arc replaces the final Despair Arc episode and serves as the finale. 

    Please note that you cannot go straight from Danganronpa: The Animation to Danganronpa 3, as Danganronpa 2 does not have an adaptation and is vital to understanding the plot of Danganronpa 3. 

    Please see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/wiki/series) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/wiki/faq) for more details.

    Your comment has been removed. There is currently a bug on New Reddit where if you are manually typing the spoiler symbols, and they are the first characters in the line, the spoiler will not show correctly. You can fix this by using Markdown Mode, using the built-in spoiler tool, or rewording your statement so the spoiler is not first on the line.
